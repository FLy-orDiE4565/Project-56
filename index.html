                <p>1. Minecraft. This game is about surviving in a blocky-like world where you have to survive with the resources you have. You can mine in caves, fight mobs that drop cool stuff, visit new biomes and dimensions, and so much more! This deserves to be in #1, because it is the most family-freindly game you will be able to find compared to others.</p>

                <p>2. Roblox. This is a game, or rather a platform, where the user can create any sort of game by scripting and buildings things that they want to make. Users can also play other people's creations publicly, and the most popular ones right now have alot more people playing than other game that aren't roblox. This is only #2 because of the community, and people can be mean and do stuff that they arent supposed to do.</p>

                <p>3. Fortnite. A multiplayer shooting game, that doesn't have very much violence since it has no blood in it. The main objective of a normal round in game is to be the last person standing on an island, where you can find guns which can range from being common to legendary. You can also do many other cool things, such as unlock new avatars, emotes, and much more! But the only reason this is in #3 is because of the community, once again. People can become very mean in this game, even when someone very little happens.</p>

                <p>4. Among us. In this game, there is 10 players, and 2 of them are imposters. The rest are crewmates, who have to finish their task around the map to win the game. But, there is a twist. The imposter can kill crewmates, go into the vents to hide, and sabotage critical parts of the map. If a crewmate finds a dead body, they report it and discuss on who was acting suspicous. The main objective of the game for imposters is to wipe out most of the crewmates on the map. This does seem like a good game. It is, but not as good as the top three. Lag can occur very well in-game, and the community once again, can be mean.</p>

                <p>5. Brawlhalla. This game is alot like the popular game <i>Super Smash Bros</i>, but it is also very different. There are way more characters, cool styles for certain characters, and crossover where they include characters from other medias. You can play online with players as well. But the only reason that this is not in the top ranks is because there isn't really that much you can do besides fighting with other characters. </p>
